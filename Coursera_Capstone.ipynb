    "When there is an oppurtunity to open a business,  the existing infrastructure affects the type of costumers present. In the Philippines, **government** hospitals are more affordable than **private** hospitals but are less accessible due to long lines and schedules. Proximity and specialty aside, *private hospitals cater to higher income patients by providing more comforts and amenities at a higher price*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the class (government or private) of the hospital affects the demographic, it would be worthwhile to learn how this affects the type of businesses and venues that exist at a walking distance from the hospital. Those visiting the hospital are also potential costumers for businesses that are a walking distance from the hospital. Using the foursquare API, data about the venues surrounding government and private hospitals can be compared to see if there is a meaningful difference. Finally, machine learning can be applied to predict whether a hospital is of the class government or private based on the businesses and venues that surround it.\n",

    "The hospitals to be used in this project are those located in the **National Capital Region of the Philippines**, which contains the cities and municipalities compromising Metropolitan Manila. This is to ensure that there is enough data from foursquare about the different venues surrounding the hospitals. A [CSV file](https://nhfr.doh.gov.ph/rfacilities2list.php?export=csv) from the Philippine Department of Health website already contains the list of health facilities as well as the street address. Geopy will be used to get the specific latitude and longitude for each hospital street address.The foursquare API will then be used to gather information about the different venues surrounding each hospital.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The specific data gathered about the venues will be the category of the venue and its number. The idea is that Government Hospitals will attract a different set of businesses from Private Hospitals. The venues gathered will be set at 500 meters, which is the maximum comfortable walking distance from the hospital. The CSV file from the department of health also contains data about each hospital's bed capacity, which can also be used for an analysis on the effect of the size of the hospital on the businesses that surround it."

    "For the exploratory analysis, it looked like the bedspace capacity has no linear correlation on the number of businesses surrounding the hospital. Atlhough it is logical to think that there should be more venues for a larger hospital, there are a number of reasons of why this might be:\n",
    "  \n",
    "* The number of patients visiting the hospital is not proportional to the bed capacity. Outpatient services that do not require beds can be a factor.  \n",
    "* The location demographics can affect the type of businesses present. For example, a highly urban city like Makati can have a high traffic of potential costumers, not necessarily from patients. A hospital located in a major highway or near a large shopping mall will also have higher number of venues surrounding it, regardless of its bed capacity. In this case, the hospital isnt even a factor at all.\n",
    "* There simply isnt enough data to test the hypothesis, either from the number of venues or the number of hospitals. With a large enough data set, a higher certainty can be achieved. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Ironically, this made the subsequent analyses easier, since the venues data no longer had to be scaled down based on the hospital capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same problems are true for the analysis of variance. Between government hospitals and private hospitals, the only difference with the a moderate certainty was the number of food courts. It can be assumed that since government hospitals cater more towards lower costs, they have more food courts than private hospitals which would be more inclined towards having restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the machine learning classification systems, all the models performed well. Each model had a test accuracy of about 70%, with K nearest neighbors having the best test accuracy at around 0.74. Training using the whole data set, the accuracy increased to 0.78. However, even after training the model using the whole data, the recall (True Positive Rate) for government hospitals was only 0.14. The Decision Tree had the lowest test accuracy at only 0.63, but after training using the whole data set, the accuracy reached 0.78 and did not suffer low recall like KNN. "

    "Answering the first questions laid out for the project, **the only discernable difference between the type of businesses/venues that surround government and private hospitals** was the number of food court venues. The size of the hospital was not a factor in the number of venues that surround it. This shows how actual data can be different from the expected results, and the importance of exploratory analysis.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Answering the second question, **predicting if a hospital is government or private based on the venues that surround it is possble**. The best model from those used was the Decision Trees Classifier, although each model performed relatively well. The converse implication of this can be of use to a stakeholder when opening a business near a hospital, in that certain types of businesses are more likely to be present (if not more successful) depending if the hospital is public or private."
